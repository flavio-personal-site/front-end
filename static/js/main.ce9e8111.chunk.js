We conducted a field experiment in Brazil to study two technologies that allow teachers to outsource grading and feedback tasks on writing practices for a national admission exam for post-secondary institutions. The first technology provides instantaneous grades and feedback using only artificial intelligence. The second uses human graders as an additional resource to enhance grading and feedback quality in aspects in which artificial intelligence arguably falls short. Both technologies significantly improved students' essay scores, and the addition of human graders did not improve effectiveness in spite of increasing perceived feedback quality. Both technologies also similarly helped teachers engage more frequently on personal discussions on essay quality with their students. Taken together, these results indicate that teachers' task composition shifted towards nonroutine activities and this helped circumvent some of the limitations of artificial intelligence. We present evidence that this happened without increases in teachers\u2019 workload. Our results illustrate an application of artificial intelligence that had first-order effects on jobs and output by productively relocating labor to tasks that represent a challenge to automation.":"",Object(c.jsxs)("div",{children:["    ",Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:" "}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3729/history/52390",children:"AEA Registration Link"})}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:p,download:!0,children:"Full Pre-Analysis Plan"})}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/friva_/status/1361716148153245698",children:"Twitter Thread"})}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(c.jsx)("span",{children:"Media Coverage: "}),Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2021/O-uso-de-intelig%C3%AAncia-artificial-na-prepara%C3%A7%C3%A3o-para-o-Enem",children:"Nexo I (BR), "})," "," ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2020/Li%C3%A7%C3%B5es-sobre-o-uso-de-recursos-tecnol%C3%B3gicos-na-educa%C3%A7%C3%A3o?utm_source=NexoNL&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=anexo",children:"Nexo II (BR), "})," "," ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/Headline_BR/status/1359583487657988102",children:", Headline (BR)"})," ",Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:" "}),Object(c.jsxs)("span",{className:"link",onClick:function(){return n(!t)},children:["Photos",t?"

Mortality effects are concentrated on intestinal infections andmalnutrition, and are greatlyminimizedwhen the local public health infrastructure is sufficiently developed (municipality coverage of piped water and sanitation).
