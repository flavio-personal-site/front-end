We conducted a field experiment in Brazil to study two technologies that allow teachers to outsource grading and feedback tasks on writing practices for a national admission exam for post-secondary institutions. The first technology provides instantaneous grades and feedback using only artificial intelligence. The second uses human graders as an additional resource to enhance grading and feedback quality in aspects in which artificial intelligence arguably falls short. Both technologies significantly improved students' essay scores, and the addition of human graders did not improve effectiveness in spite of increasing perceived feedback quality. Both technologies also similarly helped teachers engage more frequently on personal discussions on essay quality with their students. Taken together, these results indicate that teachers' task composition shifted towards nonroutine activities and this helped circumvent some of the limitations of artificial intelligence. We present evidence that this happened without increases in teachers\u2019 workload. Our results illustrate a setting where artificial intelligence had first-order effects on jobs and output by relocating labor to tasks that still represent a challenge to automation.":"",Object(c.jsxs)("div",{children:["    ",Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:" "}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3729/history/52390",children:"AEA Registration Link"})}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:p,download:!0,children:"Full Pre-Analysis Plan"})}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/friva_/status/1361716148153245698",children:"Twitter Thread"})}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(c.jsx)("span",{children:"Media Coverage: "}),Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2021/O-uso-de-intelig%C3%AAncia-artificial-na-prepara%C3%A7%C3%A3o-para-o-Enem",children:"Nexo I (BR), "})," "," ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2020/Li%C3%A7%C3%B5es-sobre-o-uso-de-recursos-tecnol%C3%B3gicos-na-educa%C3%A7%C3%A3o?utm_source=NexoNL&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=anexo",children:"Nexo II (BR), "})," "," ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/Headline_BR/status/1359583487657988102",children:", Headline (BR)"})," ",Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(c.jsx)("p",{}),Object(c.jsxs)("span",{className:"linkexp",onClick:function(){return n(!t)},children:["Visual Summary",t?"

These units are the centerpiece of the Brazilian psychiatric reform, meant to deliver community-based mental health services for people with moderate or severe disorders, including substance abuse. Using a differences-in-differences design that exploits the roll-out of the CAPSs across the country, we show that these centers improved access and utilization of outpatient mental health care and reduced hospital admissions due to mental and behavioral disorders. Those reductions were more pronounced for long-stay admissions and among patients with schizophrenia.

We find weak evidence for a decline in mortality, but a robust reduction in hospitalization rates. According to our preferred specification, an additional ATFP pharmacy per 100,000 inhabitants is associated with a decrease in hospitalization rates by diabetes of 8.2, which corresponds to 3.6% of its baseline rate. Effects are larger for Type II diabetes in comparison to Type I, and among patients with relatively lower socioeconomic status. Overall, the results are consistent with insulin-dependent patients being relatively less responsive to subsidies because of higher immediate life-threatening risks; and with lower-SES individuals being more responsive because of liquidity constraints.

Relying on detailed matched employer-employee data on the universe of public employees in Brazil over 1997\u20132014, and on a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we establish three main findings. First, political connections are a key and quantitatively large determinant of employment in public organizations, for both bureaucrats and frontline providers.

Firms reported sales increased by at least 21 percent over 4 years. The results are consistent with fixed costs of concealing collusion, increased detection probability from whistle-blower threats, and with behavioral biases associated with lotteries amplifying the enforcement value of the program.

In the context of Brazil's early 1990s trade liberalization, I find that regions facing a 10 percentage point larger liberalization-induced price decline experienced a 4 percentage point larger wage decline.
