We conducted a field experiment to study two technologies that allow teachers to outsource grading and feedback tasks on writing practices for the largest college admission exam in Brazil. The first technology provides instantaneous grades and feedback using only artificial intelligence. The second one uses human graders as an additional resource to enhance grading and feedback quality in aspects in which artificial intelligence arguably falls short. Both technologies significantly improved students' essay scores, and the addition of human graders did not improve effectiveness in spite of increasing perceived feedback quality. Both technologies also similarly helped teachers engage more frequently on personal discussions on essay quality with their students. Taken together, these results indicate that teachers' task composition shifted toward nonroutine activities and this helped circumvent some of the limitations of artificial intelligence. We present evidence that this happened without marked increases in teachers\u2019 workload. More generally, our results illustrate one realm where advances in artificial intelligence may increase human labor demand in analytical and interactive tasks that still remain a challenge to automation.":""]}),Object(c.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3729/history/52390",children:"AEA Registration Link"})}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:j,download:!0,children:"Full Pre-Analysis Plan"})}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/friva_/status/1361716148153245698",children:"Twitter Thread Link"})}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(c.jsx)("span",{children:"Media: "}),Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2021/O-uso-de-intelig%C3%AAncia-artificial-na-prepara%C3%A7%C3%A3o-para-o-Enem",children:"[Nexo I (BR)]"})," "," ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2020/Li%C3%A7%C3%B5es-sobre-o-uso-de-recursos-tecnol%C3%B3gicos-na-educa%C3%A7%C3%A3o?utm_source=NexoNL&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=anexo",children:"[Nexo II (BR)] "})," "," ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/Headline_BR/status/1359583487657988102",children:"[Headline (BR)]"})," "]})]}),Object(c.jsx)("img",{src:u,alt:"graph"}),Object(c.jsx)("img",{src:p,alt:"graph2"})]})}),f=(n(15),function(){var e=Object(a.useState)(!1),i=Object(l.a)(e,2),n=i[0],t=i[1];return Object(c.jsxs)("div",{id:"work-in-progress",children:[Object(c.jsx)(d,{children:" Work in Progress"}),Object(c.jsx)("span",{children:" Delivering Health at School and Educational Outcomes: Evidence from Brazil"}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(with Lia Braga and ",Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.rudirocha.org/",children:"Rudi Rocha"}),")"]}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(c.jsxs)("span",{className:"link",onClick:function(){return t(!n)},children:["Project Summary",n?": ":" (click to expand)"]}),n?"In this research project, we assess whether and how the introduction of the Health at School Program in Brazil from 2009 to 2014 had effects on educational outcomes. Health at School was designed to induce and standardize activities of primary health care professionals at public schools and to increase the provision of services involving screening, diagnosis and specific treatments for the identified health-related problems among children. We rely on a municipality-by-year panel and explore exogenous variation in the staggered process of program municipality prioritization for causal identification. Our results will bring contributions to a growing literature on the impacts of health improvements on human capital accumulation, and illustrate whether at-scale programs that explore schools as ideal loci for health activities may be considered an effective policy alternative that improves education.":""]})]})}),m=(n(16),n.p+"static/media/ciie_rubin_selection.85135252.pdf"),x=n.p+"static/media/ciie_rubin_selection_annbib.6e05497e.pdf",O=n.p+"static/media/ehcf_teachers_annbib.7f0b0685.pdf",g=function(){var e=Object(a.useState)(!1),i=Object(l.a)(e,2),n=i[0],t=i[1];return Object(c.jsxs)("div",{id:"learning",children:[Object(c.jsx)(d,{children:" Learning "}),Object(c.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(c.jsxs)("span",{className:"link",onClick:function(){return t(!n)},children:["Read me",n?": ":" (click to expand)"]}),n?"These are slides and annotated bibliographies (some are work in progress) for different methodological and substantive topics in applied development economics.
